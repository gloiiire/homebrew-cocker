  # Pre-compiled binary bottles published to GitHub Releases. brew
  # downloads these instead of running `swift build` on the user's
  # machine — install time drops from ~3 minutes to ~5 seconds.
  #
  # Generated automatically by `.github/workflows/bottle.yml` on every
  # release tag. The sha256 lines are rewritten by the workflow and
  # committed back to this file. `cellar :any_skip_relocation` is
  # correct here because cocker's binaries are statically positioned —
  # they don't hard-code their install prefix.
  # `bottle do` runs in a `BottleSpecification` scope that does NOT
  # have the formula's `version` method in lexical scope — using
  # `#{version}` here raises `undefined local variable 'version'` at
  # `brew info / outdated` time and bricks the tap for the user. The
  # URL has to be a literal. The `sync-homebrew-tap` workflow rewrites
  # both `version "..."` AND this `vX.Y.Z` substring on every release
  # tag so they stay in lock-step.

    # entitlement for ad-hoc signatures of locally-built binaries).

    # policies) should run :

      cockerd was ad-hoc signed (Homebrew's sandbox denies keychain access,
      so we can't read your Apple Development cert from inside the install).

      To resign with your real cert (TeamIdentifier-bearing, portable across
      machines) :

        cocker daemon resign

      Re-run after every `brew upgrade cocker`.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      cocker needs three things before it can launch containers:

      1) Apple Development signing certificate (free, one-time setup)
         Required because cockerd uses Virtualization.framework, which
         macOS only allows for binaries signed by a real Apple developer
         certificate — not an ad-hoc signature.

         How to get one:
           a) Open Xcode → Settings → Accounts
           b) Sign in with your Apple ID (free account is fine)
           c) Click "Manage Certificates" → "+" → "Apple Development"
         Then re-run:  brew postinstall cocker

      2) Apple Container Linux kernel (booted inside each container VM)
           brew install container

         If you install it after cocker, finish setup with:
           brew postinstall cocker

      3) Start the daemon
           brew services start cocker

         Logs:        #{var}/log/cockerd.log
         Verify:      cocker version
         First try:   cocker pull alpine:latest
                      cocker run -d alpine:latest -- /bin/sh -c \\
                        'while true; do date; sleep 1; done'

      Uninstalling cocker? Your container state lives in ~/.cocker
      (kept across upgrades). Remove it with:
        rm -rf ~/.cocker
    EOS
  end

  test do
    # Daemon isn't running in the test sandbox; just check the CLI binary
    # loads and shows the expected help banner.
    assert_match(/cocker/i, shell_output("#{bin}/cocker --help 2>&1", 0))
